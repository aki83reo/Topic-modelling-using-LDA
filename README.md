Topic  Modelling  is a very  important  part  of  understanding   important  features  present  in  your  document. 

It  will  group  or  cluster   important  words   into  various  topics  .

In this  code   i  used  LDA   to  find  topics  which  are similar  in nature  .  


This  code will  take  any  document (docx file)  ,   parse it   remove  stopwords  ,   remove punctuations  etc  and  create  10  most important topics .

I  used   LDA  from  gensim  library  .

You  can pull  this  repo  and do  modifications  as  per your  requirements  .  

I  hope  it will  be useful  for someone  who need  help to  find  topics .  


I  took  help  from  "Susan Li " articles  in   medium.  

The  most important  topics  from the   docx i used are   :
